Early on February 5th 2019 was reported (e.g. Power100 news [article](https://www.power100.com.au/news/local-news/150270-commonwealth-government-townsville-disaster-assistance), Townsville bulletin [article](https://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/news/townsville/1000-disaster-relief-payment-available-to-every-townsville-flood-victim-from-tuesday/news-story/a715597c5462031f43f3d8d0ab37664b)) that the Commonwealth Government had activated a Disaster Recovery Payment for people affected by the flooding. However, the [official link](https://www.disasterassist.gov.au/Documents/Fact-sheets/Disaster-Recovery-Payment-Factsheet.pdf) to this information is not working (producing a *401 UNAUTHORIZED* error) as per *05_FEB_2019_18:03*.
